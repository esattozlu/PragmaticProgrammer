## Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

Pragmatic programmers think beyond the problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.

## Topic 1. It’s Your Life
It's your life. If you are not satisfied, change it. Change is in your hands.

## Topic 2. The Cat Ate My Source Code

- Team Trust
In a healthy environment based in trust, you can safely speak your mind, present your ideas, and rely on your team members who can in turn rely on you.

- Take Responsibility
When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.
Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse.
Mistakes happen. The important thing is to handle it professionally.

## Topic 3. Software Entropy
If there is a "broken window" in the project, later developers do not hesitate to break windows. Therefore, for the sustainability of the project, it is necessary to proceed without leaving any broken windows and by repairing the defects.

## Topic 4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
Before asking for an improvement, it is necessary to show the team that it can be done by starting the process. Then, wait for the team to complete the next steps with statements such as "it would be nice if we add this too" on top of our own development. People find it easier to join an ongoing success.

## Topic 5. Good-Enough Software 
"Good enough" doesn't mean the code is sloppy or bad. Sometimes products with minor faults but working are preferred rather than perfect. The important thing is to meet the demands and needs of the users.

    - Ask the “Five Whys”
    - Who does this benefit?
